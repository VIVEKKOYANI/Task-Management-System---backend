## Task Management System Backend

This is the backend API for the Task Management System, built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and MySQL.

### Features
- User registration and login with JWT authentication
- CRUD operations for tasks (title, description, status, due date)
- Each user can only access their own tasks
- Request validation using `class-validator`
- MySQL database with TypeORM

### Endpoints

#### Auth
- `POST /auth/register` — Register a new user
  - Body: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "yourPassword" }`
- `POST /auth/login` — Login and receive a JWT token
  - Body: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "yourPassword" }`
  - Response: `{ "token": "<jwt>" }`

#### Tasks (protected, require JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header)
- `GET /tasks` — Get all tasks for the logged-in user
- `POST /tasks` — Create a new task
- `GET /tasks/:id` — Get a single task by ID
- `PUT /tasks/:id` — Update a task by ID
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` — Delete a task by ID

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root with:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=your_mysql_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_DATABASE=task_management
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Running the Server
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
   The server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

### Notes
- Make sure your MySQL server is running and the database/user exist with the correct privileges.
- The frontend should use the same API endpoints for authentication and task management.

---

For any issues, please check your `.env` configuration and MySQL connection first.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
